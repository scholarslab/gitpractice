# Some Brandon-Inspired Git Practice
Fill in your answers to each icebreaker question, then add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town?
* Shane: Tacos Gomez for carne asada, Cafe Andrade for al pastor.
* Brandon: I will defer to Shane's clear authority in this matter.
* Aaron: La Michoacana Tacqueria is the bessst! 
* Crystal: When I ate meat I loved El Tako Nako's lengua tacos. Currently big fan of Michoacana Taqueria's veg tacos.
* Elise: 
* Emma: 
* Grace: 
* Savanna: The tacos I make. Not because they're good or culinary masterpieces but because I don't have to see other people in the process of obtaining them. :) Also I don't know where to get good tacos in Charlottesville... I live near Barracks and the options over yonder are limiting in that regard. These suggestions are awesome!

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are obviously Texas and New Mexico. Iowa is also pretty good! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the phrase "State of Idaho" twice.
=======
* Crystal: I like Alaska's, which is nice and simple, and Oregon's, because the beaver is cute. I feel like saying Maryland's is my least favorite, mostly because  Marylanders are so obsessed with it.
* Savanna: I'm kind of into Alaska's, not gonna lie, though New Mexico's is stellar. Rhode Island's is the worst, or maybe the best. Instead of seeing "hope" I read "nope" which is simultaneously iconic and just sad. 

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995)
* Crystal: Dinotopia (2002)
* Savanna: Doppelganger (1993)

## What's a spot in the world you haven't been, but would really like to visit?
* Savanna: What a great question! I'm 1000% OBSESSED with Bali, as you'll soon find out, but I have in fact been there already, so that's not helpful. Maybe Egypt (which has AMAZING traditional music)? Or Rome or Austria (my fam is from there so that would be cool)? I would also love to see the Bagan temples in Myanmar. And Capetown. IDK I want to go everywhere I love traveling (though I've only been to Bali).

## If I told you I would give you a million dollars if you karaoke-sang one song perfectly, with no mistakes, and with 110% gusto, what song would you pick and why?
