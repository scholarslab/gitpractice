## Who makes the best tacos in town?
* Shane: Tacos Gomez for carne asada, Cafe Andrade for al pastor.
* Brandon: I will defer to Shane's clear authority in this matter.
* Aaron: 
* Crystal:
* Elise: 
* Emma: Brazos? Although I don't live in Charlottesville! This was the place some older art history PhD students took me when I visited campus for the first time, so there's some nostalgia involved. 
* Grace: 
* Savanna: 

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are obviously Texas and New Mexico. Iowa is also pretty good! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the phrase "State of Idaho" twice.
* Emma: I'm from Georgia originally, and our flag is boring but not terrible or offensive (like Mississippi's, which is the worst, though I hear folks are actively trying to change it). I LOVE Alaska's flag. After TAing a class called "Art and Astronomy" last year, I'm mildly obsessed with stars.

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Emma: My favorite movie period is a bad movie: Clue (1985).

## What's your favorite scent and why?
