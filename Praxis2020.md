## Who makes the best tacos in town?
* Shane: Tacos Gomez for carne asada, Cafe Andrade for al pastor.
* Brandon: I will defer to Shane's clear authority in this matter.
* Aaron: 
* Crystal:
* Elise: 
* Emma: 
* Grace: 
* Savanna: The tacos I make. Not because they're good or culinary masterpieces but because I don't have to see other people in the process of obtaining them. :)

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are obviously Texas and New Mexico. Iowa is also pretty good! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the phrase "State of Idaho" twice.
* Savanna: I'm kind of into Alaska's, not gonna lie, though New Mexico's is stellar. Rhode Island's is the worst, or maybe the best. Instead of seeing "hope" I read "nope" which is simultaneously iconic and just sad. 

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Savanna: Doppleganger (1993)
