## Who makes the best tacos in town?
* Shane: Tacos Gomez for carne asada, Cafe Andrade for al pastor.
* Brandon: I will defer to Shane's clear authority in this matter.
* Aaron: La Michoacana Tacqueria is the bessst! 
* Crystal: When I ate meat I loved El Tako Nako's lengua tacos. Currently big fan of Michoacana Taqueria's veg tacos.
* Elise: 
* Emma: 
* Grace: 
* Savanna: The tacos I make. Not because they're good or culinary masterpieces but because I don't have to see other people in the process of obtaining them. :)

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are obviously Texas and New Mexico. Iowa is also pretty good! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the phrase "State of Idaho" twice.
=======
* Crystal: I like Alaska's, which is nice and simple, and Oregon's, because the beaver is cute. I feel like saying Maryland's is my least favorite, mostly because  Marylanders are so obsessed with it.
* Savanna: I'm kind of into Alaska's, not gonna lie, though New Mexico's is stellar. Rhode Island's is the worst, or maybe the best. Instead of seeing "hope" I read "nope" which is simultaneously iconic and just sad. 

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995)
* Crystal: Dinotopia (2002)
* Savanna: Doppleganger (1993)

## What's a spot in the world you haven't been, but would like to visit the most?

* Savanna: What a great question! I'm 1000% OBSESSED with Bali, but I have in fact been there already, so that's not helpful. Maybe Egypt (which has AMAZING traditional music)? Or Rome? Salzburg, Austria (my fam is from Italy and Austria, so that would be cool)? I would also love to see the Bagan temples in Myanmar.

### If I told you I would give you a million dollars if you karaoke-sang one song perfectly, with no mistakes, and with 110% gusto, what song would you pick and why?
