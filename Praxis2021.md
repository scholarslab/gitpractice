## designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are clearly Texas and New Mexico. Iowa is also pretty good! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the phrase "State of Idaho" twice. 
* Jacqui: My former home Mississippi was very recently the worst, but I am proud of them for improving! I am partial to South Carolina and Louisiana for the best. I like pelicans.
