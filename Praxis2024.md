# Some Brandon-Inspired Git Practice
Fill in your answers to each icebreaker question, then add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town? 
* Shane: Tacos Gomez
* Gramond: Chipotle (I'm vegetarian, so limited options)

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are clearly Texas and New Mexico. Also Iowa. I have a weird soft spot for Iowa! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the words "State of Idaho" twice.
* Gramond: I like the design of Maryland's flag. California is cool also. The worst flag is my home state of Alabama for its simplicity. 

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995) -- I think this is the first depiction of a pizza being ordered through the Internet.
* Gramond: Honestly don't have a favorite bad movie because if it was bad, I would not finish it. 

## If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 
* Gramond: Superspeed, because I like the ability to get anywhere within the blink of an eye.
