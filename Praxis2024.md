# Some Brandon-Inspired Git Practice
Fill in your answers to each icebreaker question, then add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town? 
* Shane: Tacos Gomez
* Kristin: The only tacos I've had so far are from Torchy's but I'm sure they're not the best in town!

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are clearly Texas and New Mexico. Also Iowa. I have a weird soft spot for Iowa! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the words "State of Idaho" twice.
* Kristin: Best is Oregon because the reverse of the flag has a beaver! Worst is Arkansas - I don't know, it's just a little boring?

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995) -- I think this is the first depiction of a pizza being ordered through the Internet.
* Kristin: Hercules Unchained (1959) -- I love this movie because it's featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, where they spend the whole episode riffing on the movie.
