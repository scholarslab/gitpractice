Fill in your answers to each icebreaker question, then add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town? 
* Oriane: I don't think I've ever had a taco in my life, unfortunately. 
* Kristin: The only tacos I've had so far are from Torchy's but I'm sure they're not the best in town!
* Gramond: Chipotle (I'm vegetarian, so limited options)
* Shane: Tacos Gomez

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Oriane: I really like Washington (looks really camp). Colorado looks really boring (also who thought the combination of red blue white YELLOW would be good?)
* Kristin: Best is Oregon because the reverse of the flag has a beaver! Worst is Arkansas - I don't know, it's just a little boring?
* Gramond: I like the design of Maryland's flag. California is cool also. The worst flag is my home state of Alabama for its simplicity. 

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Oriane: any Neil Breen movie is a gem. Personal favourites: Pass Thru (2016), Fateful Findings (2021). Favourite quote: "I resign today, as President of The Bank". 
* Kristin: Hercules Unchained (1959) -- I love this movie because it's featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000, where they spend the whole episode riffing on the movie. 
* Gramond: Honestly don't have a favorite bad movie because if it was bad, I would not finish it. 

## If you were a cocktail (or a mocktail) what would you be made of and what would your name be?
* Oriane: "Piko√π Panez Under the Sun": prosecco, vinho verde, (French) cider, lavender, rose, flower petals, orgeat, brown sugar, lime, chili powder.
* Kristin: something very sweet! My name would probably be something silly like "the most basic mocktail ever"
* Gramond: I don't drink, so a virgin cocktail.

## If you could have one superpower, what would it be? 
* Gramond: Superspeed, because I like the ability to get anywhere within the blink of an eye.
