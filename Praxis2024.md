# Some Brandon-Inspired Git Practice
Fill in your answers to each icebreaker question, then add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town? 
* Shane: Tacos Gomez
* Amna: They're all underseasoned!

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are clearly Texas and New Mexico. Also Iowa. I have a weird soft spot for Iowa! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the words "State of Idaho" twice.
* Amna: Best: New Mexico and the reverse side of Oregon. Worst: there is a dizzying array of red white and blue that's very hard to choose from.

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995) -- I think this is the first depiction of a pizza being ordered through the Internet.
* Amna: The Dictator - it pains me to make this public

## What was your favourite cartoon character as a child?
