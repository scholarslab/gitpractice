# Some Brandon-Inspired Git Practice
Fill in your answers to each icebreaker question, then add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best pizza in town? 
* Shane: A Squared Pizza (this question is entirely just an ad for A Squared and Detroit-style pizza)
Leo: Lampo is the least bad 
## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are clearly Texas and New Mexico. I have a weird soft spot for Iowa too. Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the words "State of Idaho" twice. 
Leo: I like California's
## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995) -- I think this is the first depiction of a pizza being ordered through the Internet. 
Leo: the room is the only bad cult movie I've seen but I loved it
