Fill in your answers to each icebreaker question, then add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town? 
* Shane: Tacos Gomez

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are clearly Texas and New Mexico. I have a weird soft spot for Iowa! Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the words "State of Idaho" twice.
