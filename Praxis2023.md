# Some Brandon-Inspired Git Practice
Fill in your answers to each icebreaker question, then add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town? 
* Shane: Tacos Gomez
* Amanda: wherever Shane says

## What are the best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best are clearly Texas and New Mexico. Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the words "State of Idaho" twice.
* Amanda: Texas as both best/worst. But I also need to tell yall that the Isle of Man's flag is currently my favorite country-ish entity flag as it is wild (3 legs!?).

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995) - I think this is the first depiction of a pizza being ordered through the Internet.
